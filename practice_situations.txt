Warmup: Thinking Data First

Lay out the data architecture you'd need to implement to build the following scenarios:

1. A site for pet-sitting (watching someone's pet while they're gone). 
People can babysit for multiple pets and pets can have multiple petsitters.
This is a "has-many :through relationship"

class Pets
  has_many :appointments
  has_many :petsitters, through: :appointments

end

class PetSitters
  has_many :appointments
  has_many :pets, through: :appointments
end

class Appointments
  belongs_to :pets
  belongs_to :petsitters
end

2. You like hosting people for dinner so you want to build a dinner party 
invitation site. A user can create parties, invite people to a party, 
and accept an invitation to someone else's party.

There are several moving parts here. 
- User(hosts, and attendants)
- Parties(has many attendants, has only ONE host)

class User
  #attributes
  #host_id, attendant_id
  has_many :invitations, :foreign_key => "party_attendees_id"
  has_many :parties, :through => :invitations, :source => :attended_parties
  has_many :hosted_parties, :foreign_key => hosted_parties_id, :class_name => "Parties"
end


class Invitations 
  belongs_to :party_attendees, :class_name => "User"
  belongs_to :attended_parties, :class_name => "Parties"
end

class Parties
  #attributes
  #hosted_parties_id
  #attended_parties_id
  
  has_many :invitations, :foreign_key => :attended_parties_id
  has_many :attendees, :through => :invitations, :source => party_attendees
  belongs_to :host, :class_name => "User"
  
end


3. Extra credit (tricky): You and your friends just love posting things and 
following each other. How would you set up the models so a user can 
follow another user?

attributes:
1. Users(Followers(other users))
2. Posts

Insights: Posts belong to users
Users: Users have followers which are other users

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :networks

  has_many :followers, through => :networks
  has_many :following, through => :networks
end

class Networks
  belong_to :follower, :class_name => "User"
  belongs_to :following, :class_name => "User"
end
